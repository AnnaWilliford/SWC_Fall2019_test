## Lesson5: Data visualization with ggplot2
This lesson is based on [this Software Carpentry lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/08-plot-ggplot2/index.html)

## Introduction
R is one of the most powerful programming language for visualizing data. It isoften used to generate publication-quality graphics. Today, we will give you a flavor of some of the quality plotting you can produce using the `R` package [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). `ggplot2` is perhaps the best package for intuitive generation of high-quality figures. We will continue using the **gapminder** dataset and will visualize some of the trends in these data with `ggplot2`. Check out some of the interesting dynamic plots available from the [Gapminder website](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles). By the end of this lesson you will know the basic principles necessary to produce similar, static versions of many of the example plots you are looking at. 


## Objectives
- To be able to use `ggplot2` to generate publication-quality graphics.
- To understand the basic *grammar of graphics*, including the aesthetics and geometry layers, adding statistics, transforming scales, and coloring or panelling by groups.
#### Keypoints
- Use `ggplot2` to create plots.
- Think about graphics in layers: aesthetics, geometry, statistics, scale transformation, and grouping.


## Background

Plotting our data is one of the best ways to quickly explore it and the various relationships between variables.

There are three main plotting systems in R, the [base plotting system][base], the [lattice][lattice] package, and the [ggplot2][ggplot2] package.

[base]: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.1
[lattice]: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html
[ggplot2]: http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/

Today we'll be learning about the `ggplot2` package, because it is the most effective for creating publication-quality graphics.

`ggplot2` is built on the *grammar of graphics*, the idea that any plot can be generated from the same set of components: a **data** set, a **coordinate system**, and a set of **geoms** (the visual representation of data points).

The key to understanding `ggplot2` is thinking about a figure in layers. This idea may be familiar to you if you have used image editing programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, or Inkscape.
[Main components of ggplot](https://darencard.github.io/public_resources/R/ggplot_intro_slides.pdf)


## Quickstart

We will be working in `Lesson5_DataVisualizationR` folder. Please copy `gapminder.txt` from `Data` folder to `Lesson5_DataVisualizationR` folder. Navigate to `Lesson5_DataVisualizationR` folder in RStudio and set this folder as your working directory.  

We will need to install `ggplot2` package. Let's use console window to do that:
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
Now let's work in scripting mode (text editor) so we can save all our commands to file. Open a new file, save as `ggplot.R`. Make sure your new file is visible in `Lesson5_DataVisualizationR`folder under `Files` tab in the bottom-right pannel.

Remember that in order to work with `ggplot2` package, we need to load it into R.
```{r}
#load package into R
library(ggplot2)
```

Now let's load our **gapminder** dataset into `R`.

```{r load_gaminder, message=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.table("gapminder.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")

#view the dataset to know what variables are present (or what can be potentially plotted)
head(gapminder)
#or view as a table using environment tab in the top-right panel
```

We are now ready to plot. Let's start off with an example:

```{r lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

So the first thing we do is call the `ggplot` function. This function lets R know that we're creating a new plot, and any of the arguments we give the `ggplot` function are the **global** options for the plot: **they apply to all layers on the plot**.

We've passed in two arguments to `ggplot`. First, we tell `ggplot` what data we want to show on our figure, in this example the gapminder data we read in earlier. For the second argument we passed in the `aes` function, which tells `ggplot` how variables in the **data** map to *aesthetic* properties of the figure, in this case the **x** and **y** locations. Here we told `ggplot` we want to plot the `gdpPercap` column of the gapminder data frame on the x-axis, and the `lifeExp` column on the y-axis. Notice that we didn't need to explicitly pass these columns to `aes` function (e.g. `x = gapminder[, "gdpPercap"]`), this is because `ggplot` is smart enough to know to look in the **data** for that column!

Let's break this long command into parts:
By itself, the call to `ggplot` isn't enough to draw a figure:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```

We need to tell `ggplot` how we want to visually represent the data, which we do by adding a new **geom** layer. In our example, we used `geom_point`, which tells `ggplot` we want to visually represent the relationship between **x** and **y** as a scatterplot of points:

```{r lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter2}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

And here you have it - your first plot with `ggplot2`!  
The **three components that must be specified** (minimum) to build a plot with `ggplot2` are:

* data
* aesthetic mappings (aes)
* geometric oblects (geom)

## Layers

Now let's talk about layers. In `ggplot2`, layers are added with `+` operator, giving an intuitive understanding about the content of each layer. In the above example, `geom_point()` layer contained points.
Now, using a scatterplot probably isn't the best for visualizing change over time. Instead, let's tell `ggplot` to visualize the data as a line plot:

```{r lifeExp-line}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line()
```

Instead of adding a `geom_point` layer, we've added a `geom_line` layer. We've added the **by** *aesthetic*, which tells `ggplot` to draw a line for each country.

But what if we want to visualize both lines and points on the plot? We can simply add another layer to the plot:

```{r lifeExp-line-point}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```

It's important to note that each layer is drawn on top of the previous layer. In this example, the points have been drawn *on top of* the lines. Here's a demonstration:

```{r lifeExp-layer-example-1}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=continent)) + geom_point()
```

In this example, the *aesthetic* mapping of **color** has been moved from the global plot options in `ggplot` to the `geom_line` layer so it no longer applies to the points. Now we can clearly see that the points are drawn on top of the lines.

**In general**, each geom layer has 5 components that have different defaults depending on the geom type. Read more about layers [here]( https://rpubs.com/hadley/ggplot2-layers). For example, `geom_point()` is really a short way of writing:
```
layer(
  mapping = NULL, 
  data = NULL,
  geom = "point",
  stat = "identity",
  position = "identity"
) 
```
When `geom_point()` is called, `mapping`(aes) and `data` take values specified in `ggplot()`, and `stat` and `position` arguments take specified defaults. But each of the components can be set for each layer separately, overriding global values. Different combinations of these components generate different geoms. You can have geom_line(), geom_bar(), geom_boxplot(), geom_text(), geom_errorbar()â€¦ over 30 geoms.  

Here are the settings for `geom_bar()`. You will get to make a bar plot at the end of the lesson.
```
layer(
  mapping = NULL, 
  data = NULL,
  geom = "bar",
  stat = "count",
  position = "stack"
)
```
Here is a full [documentation for ggplot2 package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf). And also [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms).  What is important here is to know that you can specify these settings for every layer separately as we have seen in the previous example when we specified mapping for geom_line():  `geom_line(aes(color=continent))`.  
  
 

> ### Tip: Setting an aesthetic to a value instead of a mapping
>
> So far, we've seen how to use an aesthetic (such as **color**) as a *mapping* to a variable in the data. For example, when we use `geom_line(aes(color=continent))`, ggplot will give a different color to each continent. But what if we want to change the colour of all lines to blue? You may think that `geom_line(aes(color="blue"))` should work, but it doesn't. Since we don't want to create a mapping to a specific variable, we simply move the color specification outside of the `aes()` function, like this: `geom_line(color="blue")`.

```{r lifeExp-layer-example-1}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +
     geom_line(color="blue") + geom_point()
```
> ### Challenge

> >

## Transformations and statistics

`ggplot` also makes it easy to overlay statistical models over the data. To demonstrate we'll go back to our first example:

```{r lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter3, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

Currently it's hard to see the relationship between the points due to some strong outliers in GDP per capita. We can change the scale of units on the x axis using the *scale* functions. These control the mapping between the data values and visual values of an aesthetic. We can also modify the transparency of the points, using the *alpha* function, which is especially helpful when you have a large amount of data which is very clustered.

```{r axis-scale}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10()
```

The `log10` function applied a transformation to the values of the gdpPercap column before rendering them on the plot, so that each multiple of 10 now only corresponds to an increase in 1 on the transformed scale, e.g. a GDP per capita of 1,000 is now 3 on the x axis, a value of 10,000 corresponds to 4 on the x axis and so on. This makes it easier to visualize the spread of data on the x-axis.

> ### Tip Reminder: Setting an aesthetic to a value instead of a mapping
>
> Notice that we used `geom_point(alpha = 0.5)`. As the previous tip mentioned, using a setting outside of the `aes()` function will cause this value to be used for all points, which is what we want in this case. But just like any other aesthetic setting, *alpha* can also be mapped to a variable in the data. For example, we can give a different transparency to each continent with `geom_point(aes(alpha = continent))`.

We can fit a simple relationship to the data by adding another layer, `geom_smooth`:

```{r lm-fit}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

We can make the line thicker by *setting* the **size** aesthetic in the `geom_smooth` layer:

```{r lm-fit2}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm", size=1.5)
```

> ### Challenge

## Multi-panel figures

Earlier we visualized the change in life expectancy over time across all countries in one plot. Alternatively, we can split this out over multiple panels by adding a layer of **facet** panels. Focusing only on those countries with names that start with the letter "A" or "Z".

> ### Tip
>
> We start by subsetting the data. We use `startsWith` function to select names of countries that start with either letter 'A' or 'Z'. This function returns a logical vector. We can then use it to subset rows in `gapminder` dataset.  

```{r facet}
az_rows=startsWith(as.vector(gapminder$country), c('A','Z') )
az_countries <- gapminder[az_rows, ]
ggplot(data = az_countries, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country)
```

The `facet_wrap` layer took a "formula" as its argument, denoted by the tilde (~). This tells R to draw a panel for each unique value in the country column of the gapminder dataset.

## Modifying text

To clean this figure up for a publication we need to change some of the text elements. The x-axis is too cluttered, and the y axis should read "Life expectancy", rather than the column name in the data frame.

We can do this by adding a couple of different layers. The **theme** layer controls the axis text, and overall text size. Labels for the axes, plot  title and any legend can be set using the `labs` function. Legend titles are set using the same names we used in the `aes` specification. Thus below the color legend title is set using `color = "Continent"`, while the title  of a fill legend would be set using `fill = "MyTitle"`.  `Fill` is used instead of `color` when geoms are filled with color, like bar plots, for example.

```{r theme}
ggplot(data = az_countries, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",              # x axis title
    y = "Life expectancy",   # y axis title
    title = "Figure 1",      # main title of figure
    color = "Continent"      # title of legend
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45), axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
```

## Exporting the plot

The `ggsave()` function allows you to export a plot created with `ggplot`. You can specify the dimension and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments (`width`, `height` and `dpi`) to create high quality graphics for publication. In order to save the plot from above, we first assign it to a variable `lifeExp_plot`, then tell `ggsave` to save that plot in `png` format.

```{r theme}
lifeExp_plot <- ggplot(data = az_countries, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",              # x axis title
    y = "Life expectancy",   # y axis title
    title = "Figure 1",      # main title of figure
    color = "Continent"      # title of legend
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45), axis.ticks.x=element_blank())

ggsave(filename = "lifeExp.png", plot = lifeExp_plot, width = 12, height = 10, dpi = 300, units = "cm")
```
**Note** `ggsave` saves the last plot by default, so `plot` argument can be omitted. But if you created plots earlier in your script and want to save them later, you can specify which plot to save.
```
#saves the last plot by default
ggsave("myPlot.pdf")

#can specify what plot to save
ggsave("myPlot.pdf", plot=fp1)
```

This is a taste of what you can do with `ggplot2`. RStudio provides a really useful [cheat sheet][cheat] of the different layers available, and more extensive documentation is available on the [ggplot2 website][ggplot-doc]. Finally, if you have no idea how to change something, a quick Google search will usually send you to a relevant question and answer on Stack Overflow with reusable code to modify!

## Demo some more advanced features
If time permits, the following interactive activities can be run to showcase some of the cool stuff you can do with `ggplot` and `R`.

Let's do this in terms of one of the cooler visualizations directly from the [**Gapminder** website](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_chart-type=bubbles). This visualization shows the relationship between income and life expectancy for all nations in the dataset. The points are scaled in size based on the population size of the nation and colored based on continent. So there is a lot of details here. 

> ### Challenge
>
> Can we create something pretty similar using `ggplot`? What variables in our dataset needs to be mapped to what aesthetics to achive this?
>
> > #### Solution
> >
> > x = income
> > y = life expectancy
> > size = population size
> > color = continent
> >
> ### Challenge 
> 
> Use mappings above to produce a similar plot for 2007. Bonus points if you can use `dplyr` to do it.
>
> >  #### Solution 
> >
> > ```{r ch6b-bubble-plot}
> > # note that you can save plot to variable and plot later

> >      labs(

> >        y = "Life expectancy"    # y axis title
> >      )
> > bubble
> > ```

This is great, but you'll notice that it this plot is static, while the online one is interactive. Turns out is is actually pretty easy to create an interactive version when you know a little `ggplot`, using a package called `plotly`. Let's demo this.

```{r plotly_demo}
install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)

# plotly has built in support for `ggplot` objects
bubble <- gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2007) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap,
               y = lifeExp,
               color = continent,
               size = pop,
               text = country)) +
    geom_point() + 
    labs(
        x = "Income",            # x axis title
        y = "Life expectancy"    # y axis title
    )
    
ggplotly(bubble)
```

Now you'll see an interactive plot, which is really awesome for exploring and for showing off your data.

The last thing we're missing from the **Gapminder** plot is the fact that it will cycle through years. We can't mimic this with with interactive plots at each time, but we can loop through plots for each year and make a movie-like animation. A pretty simple loop will do this.

```{r animate_demo}
for (yr in unique(gapminder$year)) {
   bubble <- gapminder %>%
      filter(year == yr) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap,
                 y = lifeExp,
                 color = continent,
                 size = pop)) +
         geom_point() + 
         labs(
           x = "Income", 
           y = "Life expectancy",
           title = yr
         ) 
    plot(bubble)    # need to do this in loops
    Sys.sleep(5)    # 5 sec pause between plots
}
```

Very cool. See how easy it is to produce fancy plots in`R`!
